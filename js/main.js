//Write a function called 'playRound()' that will play a single round of 'Rock Paper Scissors'.


    //Prompt for player selection 
    //Make the selection case insensitive
    //If the player has not entered a valid option, restart round and prompt again
    //Randomly assign the computers selection.
        //by generating a number between 1 and 3
        //and assigning 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' as values instead of 1,2 or 3
    //Determine if the player won and console log a string that declares the winner of the round in the format "You Lose! Paper beats Rock."
    //return the result


//Create a new function called 'game()' which calls the 'playRound' function 5 times,
//track the score
//determine and declares a winner, loser, or tie game.
